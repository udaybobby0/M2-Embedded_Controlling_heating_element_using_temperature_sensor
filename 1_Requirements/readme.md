## Introduction
  The project aim is to develop design automation in product development. Design automation causes increase in producibility and decrease in product cost and manufacturing lead time.the main aim of this project is it will reduces the human effort and if the person sits in car sensor senses the presence of person and turn on the heater button.A sensor is a device that measures physical input from its environment and converts it into data that can be interpreted by either a human or a machine. so after detection of person the heater button will be turned on accrording to temperature in car, the heater will very its values so that person sitting in the car feels  comfortable.Seat heaters are either available as internally integrated underneath the seat which is also called heated seat, or as an external device in the form of pad or cushion.Seat heaters are either available as internally integrated underneath the seat which is also called heated seat, or as an external device in the form of pad or cushion.

# 4W & 1H
## Where:
  heater are used in factories and industries.
 
## Who:
  workers or empolyees in factories and industries.
  
## When:
   to control the required temperature.

## What:
   It heats the boiler.

## How:
   1. Button Sensor will check the boiler is on or not.
   2. Temperature sensor work as per mentioned.
   3. Display CDD-CRO will give the temperature value by showing PWM.
   4. Heater will check the heater button is ON.

# 4W & 1H
## Where:
  heater are used in factories and industries.
 
## Who:
  workers or empolyees in factories and industries.
  
## When:
   Depending on the temperature

## What:
   It heats the boiler.

## How:
   1. Button Sensor will check the boiler is on or not.
   2. Temperature sensor work as per mentioned.
   3. Display CDD-CRO will give the temperature value by showing PWM.
